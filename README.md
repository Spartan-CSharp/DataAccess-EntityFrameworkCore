# DataAccess-EntityFrameworkCore
The homework from Lesson 14, Entity Framework Core, of Module 8, Data Access, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a simple database using code first. Create models for People, Addresses, and Employers. Make sure it builds and that you can load and save data.
